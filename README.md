##  Sql Query Proxy to Elasticsearch, Mongo, Kubernetes, BigTable, etc.

Unify disparate data sources and files into a single Federated
view of your data and query with SQL without copying into datawarehouse.


Mysql compatible federated query engine to Elasticsearch, Mongo, 
Google Datastore, Cassandra, Google BigTable, Kubernetes, file-based sources.
This query engine hosts a mysql protocol listener, 
which rewrites sql queries to native (elasticsearch, mongo, cassandra, kuberntes-rest-api, bigtable).
It works by implementing a full relational algebra distributed execution engine
to run sql queries and poly-fill missing features
from underlying sources.  So, a backend key-value storage such as cassandra
can now have complete `WHERE` clause support as well as aggregate functions etc.

Most similar to [prestodb](http://prestodb.io/) but in Golang, and focused on
easy to add custom data sources as well as REST api sources.

## Storage Sources

* [Google Big Table](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/bigtable) SQL against big-table [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/).
* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/elasticsearch) Simplify access to Elasticsearch.
* [Mongo](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/mongo) Translate SQL into mongo.
* [Google Cloud Storage / (csv, json files)](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/files) An example of REST api backends (list of files), as well as the file contents themselves are tables.
* [Cassandra](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/cassandra) SQL against cassandra.  Adds sql features that are missing.
* [Lytics](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/lytics) SQL against [Lytics REST Api's](https://www.getlytics.com)
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/kubernetes) An example of REST api backend.
* [Google Big Query](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/bigquery) MYSQL against worlds best analytics datawarehouse [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).
* [Google Datastore](https://github.com/dataux/dataux/tree/master/backends/datastore) MYSQL against [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/).


## Features

* *Distributed*  run queries across multiple servers
* *Hackable Sources*  Very easy to add a new Source for your custom data, files, json, csv, storage.
* *Hackable Functions* Add custom go functions to extend the sql language.
* *Joins* Get join functionality between heterogeneous sources.
* *Frontends* currently only MySql protocol is supported but RethinkDB (for real-time api) is planned, and are pluggable.
* *Backends*  Elasticsearch, Google-Datastore, Mongo, Cassandra, BigTable, Kubernetes currently implemented.  Csv, Json files, and custom formats (protobuf) are in progress.

## Status
* NOT Production ready.  Currently supporting a few non-critical use-cases (ad-hoc queries, support tool) in production.



## Try it Out
This example imports a couple hours worth of historical data
from  https://www.githubarchive.org/ into a local
elasticsearch server for example.  Requires [nats.io](http://nats.io)
and etcd server running local as well. Docker setup coming soon.
```sh

cd tools/importgithub
# assuming elasticsearch on localhost elase --host=myeshost
go build && ./importgithub

# using dataux.conf from root of this project
go build
./dataux --config=dataux.conf

# now that dataux is running use mysql-client to connect

mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000
```
now run some queries
```sql
use datauxtest;

show tables;

describe github_watch;

select cardinality(`actor`) AS users_who_watched, min(`repository.id`) as oldest_repo from github_watch;

SELECT actor, `repository.name`, `repository.stargazers_count`, `repository.language`
FROM github_watch where `repository.language` = "Go";

select actor, repository.name from github_watch where repository.stargazers_count BETWEEN "1000" AND 1100;

SELECT actor, repository.organization AS org
FROM github_watch 
WHERE repository.created_at BETWEEN "2008-10-21T17:20:37Z" AND "2008-10-21T19:20:37Z";

select actor, repository.name from github_watch where repository.name IN ("node", "docker","d3","myicons", "bootstrap") limit 100;

select cardinality(`actor`) AS users_who_watched, count(*) as ct, min(`repository.id`) as oldest_repo
FROM github_watch
WHERE repository.description LIKE "database";

# to add other data sources see dataux.conf example

```

Roadmap(ish)
------------------------------
* Sources
  * Big-Query
  * Big-Table
  * Json-Files
* Writes
  * write pub/sub:  inbound insert/update are available as pub-sub messages.
  * write propogation:  inbound insert/update gets written multiple places.
  * write lambda functions:  allow arbitray functions to get nats.io pub/sub of write events.

**Hacking**

* see **tools/importgithub** for tool to import 2 days of github data for examples above.

```sh
# to run queries below, run test data import

go get -u github.com/dataux/dataux
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dataux/dataux/tools/importgithub
go build
./importgithub  ## will import ~200k plus docs from Github archive

```

Other Projects, Database Proxies & Multi-Data QL

* ***Data-Accessability*** Making it easier to query, access, share, and use data.   Protocol shifting (for accessibility).  Sharing/Replication between db types.

***[codis](https://github.com/wandoulabs/codis)***                         | Y |   | for scaling redis
***[MariaDB MaxScale](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale)***  | Y |   | for scaling mysql/mariadb (sharding) mature
***[Netflix Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite)***              | Y |   | not really sql, just multi-store k/v 
***[redishappy](https://github.com/mdevilliers/redishappy)***              | Y |   | for scaling redis, haproxy
***[mixer](https://github.com/siddontang/mixer)***                         | Y |   | simple mysql sharding 

We use more and more databases, flatfiles, message queues, etc.
For db's the primary reader/writer is fine but secondary readers 
such as investigating ad-hoc issues means we might be accessing 
and learning many different query languages.
